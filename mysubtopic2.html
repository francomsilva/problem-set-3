        <h3>Brass</h3>
          <p>The brass section consists of a mixture of high and low brass. High brass includes a mixture of trumpets and mellophones, which is basically a french horn made for marching. It plays and sounds like one, and it looks like a trumpet, except its bigger, especially its bell. Low brass typically include a mixture of baritones, tubas, and sousaphones. These are very big, heavy instruments that play really low notes and pitches. Here is a picture of all of these instruments.</p>
